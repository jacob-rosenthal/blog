    "## Defining the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model we will be using is a very simple Markov chain model. First, we model each wine review as a sequence of word pairs (i.e. bigrams). Then, we create new reviews by chaining together word pairs using a single rule which is used to generate the next word given the preceding word as input. We simply look through a dataset of real wine reviews and find all occurences of the preceding word, then randomly pick one of them and use whatever word followed it in that context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the algorithm for generating the n-th word $w_n$ given the preceding word $w_{n-1}$ and a dataset $D$:\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm $g(w_n | w_{n-1}, D)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find $O = \\{o_1, o_2, \\dots, o_m\\}$, the set of all $m$ occurences of $w_{n-1}$ in $D$\n",
    "* Randomly choose an occurence $o_k \\in O$  \n",
    "* Return the word immediately following $o_k$ in its original context\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the generation of each word depends only on the previous word, it is completely independent of all the other preceding words in the description so far. In other words, $P(w_n | w_{n-1}) = P(w_n | w_{n-1}, w_{n-2}, \\dots, w_{1})$. This means that our model is a [Markovian process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Definition). The transition probabilities between bigrams are empirically determined from our corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course this is probably not going to be a great model, since it does not consider any of the context besides the immediately preceding word. But it can still give surprisingly good results, as it lets us capture many of the common two-word phrases which define the genre of wine reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's take a look at implementing this model."

    "\n",
    "However, we know that many of the word pairs will appear quite frequently! If we just parse into a list of all word pairs, we might have 100 identical entries on our list for \"rich tannins.\" We can instead count how times a word pair occurs, and keep track of the counts of all the tokens. When it comes time to sample the next word, we can simply use probabilities proportional to the counts instead of uniformly sampling! This will let us generate words without having to process the entire set of all the token pairs in our entire dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each descriptions in the dataset is a single string. We need to divide the descriptions into their individual words, so we can count the word pairs. This process is called *tokenization*, where we divide the input into a set of tokens. \n",

    "\n",
    "The descriptions certainly aren't great - I don't think any human would be fooled! However, given how rudimentary our model is, the results are surprisingly good. The sentences are mostly coherent, and they also do well at capturing the  vocabulary and phrases distinctive of the wine description genre! This shows how even the simplest model can \"learn\" features distinctive of the dataset it was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course we could improve on this model by using 3-grams or 4-grams instead of bigrams, which would let us capture more context. Or, we could use NLP methods that are much better than Markov chains! Recurrent neural networks, transformers, etc... Maybe we'll look at those in a future notebook.\n",
